# Paper run — September 6, 2026 onward

User objective: exploit stale bids on a player's tournament winner and future
round qualification markets as their match becomes decided. Remain paper-only.
Use the book for speed; investigate asynchronous score context for false-signal
protection. Current cash is not the strategy's scaling limit.

## Starting state

- Existing systemd paper service was active from 20:25 UTC, receiving updates,
  with a $500 hard cap. Two separate tennis collectors were also running.
- This server was a deployment, with no Git history. Imported its source into
  the user-provided GitHub repository, main branch, commit `b871853`.
- Legacy September 6 action log: Eala FIN, Mensik WIN, Kostyuk WIN each sold
  38 at 2 cents and recorded roughly $0.71 profit after a NO result. These
  used instantaneous assumed full fills and are not execution validation.
- Baseline tests passed with network enabled. Fixed the FakeScan fixture to
  seed empty ADVANCE markets, eliminating accidental real API calls. They now
  pass offline as advertised.

## Findings

The existing elimination trigger means started match + no YES bid + YES ask
at most 2 cents. It is an inference, not confirmation. Replayed September 5
collector data for Zheng against Keys: three false episodes lasting 124.561,
24.663, and 31.532 seconds. **Each reached an ask of 1 cent**, so tightening
the threshold alone does not solve the known false positive. Zheng later won.
The raw episode output is in `data/research/false_signal_episodes.json`.
The replay used the legacy collector's reconstructed books; further sequence
validation is needed before treating every reconstructed state as ground truth.

Kalshi public market rules were checked for Kostyuk's match and FIN leg:
match winner is conditional on a ball being played; qualification settles YES
even if the player qualifies but does not subsequently compete. A loss must
therefore only price *future* rounds, never an already achieved qualification.
Public v1 event metadata supplies round and a started label, but the inspected
response had no live score. Milestones contain competitor IDs and source IDs;
their `status` can still say `not_started`, so it is not yet a trusted outcome.

The user reports match markets usually remain available long enough after the
last point. Keeping related books after closure is secondary to signal quality.

## First changes

- Paper orders wait 100 ms by default, then fill at most the quantity still
  displayed at their limit. No price improvement is assumed.
- A separate remaining-depth ledger prevents taking the same simulated resting
  orders repeatedly. Positive YES deltas replenish it; cancellations reduce it;
  snapshots cannot replenish an already observed price level. This deliberately
  underestimates fills when cancellations concern orders already simulated filled.
- Paper positions, cap usage, realized P&L and consumed depth persist in an
  atomically replaced, fsynced account file. Corrupt state stops the run.
  Legacy fills are excluded from this new account; the previous run held none
  at the time of inspection.
- Websocket reconnect clears old books. Entries and R sampling wait for all
  subscriptions' snapshots. Missing/out-of-order sequence numbers force resync.
- Settled legs cannot be re-entered.
- Signal transitions log 1-cent/2-cent states, recovery, related bids and
  decisions. Takes record signal type, fill model and elapsed time.
- Original suite plus five focused paper tests pass on Python 3.14.

## Still required before judging readiness

Collect at least one day with the improved simulation. Measure false signals,
missed opportunities, partial/zero fills, score-feed delay, and settlement P&L.
Audit market rules/round joins, feed reconstruction, fee rounding and live order
accounting. The current inferred-elimination path still uses fair=0 and bypasses
comeback caps; paper results on that path are **not** evidence of zero risk.
No live transition is authorized by this run.
